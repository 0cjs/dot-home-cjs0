#   tmset - remote tmate settings hack
#
#   Though my tmux config file changes the prefix to C-a, this of course
#   has no effect when ssh'ing into a tmate session started on someone
#   _else's_ host. For that, we must run `tmate` on their machine, giving
#   it commands to update the configuration. Only a single command can be
#   given as a command-line parameter (e.g., `tmate show-messages` or
#   `tmate display-message 'Hello, world.'`).
#
#   Ideally we'd use Control Mode to send in a set of parameters but,
#   though we have code below to do this, it doesn't totally work. So we
#   hack it by just running `tmate` multiple times, giving it each command
#   in turn.

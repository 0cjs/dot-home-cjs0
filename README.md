==============

This is a [dot-home] module. To use it:

    mkdir -p ~/.home
    cd ~/.home
    git clone https://github.com/dot-home/_dot-home.git     # Core system
    git clone https://github.com/dot-home/cjs-minimal.git   # This repo
    ~/.home/_dot-home/bin/dot-home-setup

This is a minimal dot-file configuration for Curt not to to stall a
lot when typing on someone else's account. It tries as much as
possible not to interfere or conflict with other people's preferred
configurations, sometimes by requiring explicit activation for certain
parts.

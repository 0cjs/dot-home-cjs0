==============

This is a [dot-home] module. Clone both this and [_dot-home] under
`~/.home/` and then run `~/.home/_dot-home/bin/dot-home-setup`.

This is a minimal dot-file configuration for Curt not to to stall a
lot when typing on someone else's account. It tries as much as
possible not to interfere or conflict with other people's preferred
configurations, sometimes by requiring explicit activation for certain
parts.

# cjs minimal early bash config

#   Bash will generate an error if you define a function of the same name
#   as an existing alias, so we need to ensure those aliases do not exist.
#   Further, the unalias command must not happen on the same line, as later
#   in that line the alias will already have been substituted. This makes
#   it easy to unalias things that might conflict with functions we're
#   about to define.
_u() { unalias "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; }

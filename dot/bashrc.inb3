    #   We must source our .bashrc in the child shell because settings
    #   from it (e.g., shell functions) are generally not inherited.
    #   We do not use `-l` for a login shell, because that generally
    #   sets env vars and the like that are inhereted, and we want to
    #   inherit the changed value. Nor do we use `-i` (interactive),
    #   becuase while that sources the .bashrc it doesn't exit
    #   properly, producing messed-up job control.

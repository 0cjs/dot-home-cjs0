#   cjs final configuration

#   Ensure that ~/.local/bin is at the front of the path,
#   even if other stuff got put in front of it during setup.
prepath -f -n -q $HOME/.local/bin

#   My most commonly-used and -missed functions, but we don't override
#   them if they have already been set by previous configuration.
#
#   The code to define a Bash function that has the same name as an alias
#   that exists *during parsing* produces a "syntax error near unexpected
#   token `('". To avoid this we create a temporary "file" (using process
#   substitution) and evalulate the contents of it in the current
#   environment; because the "file" is parsed separately in an environment
#   without the parent environment's aliases, it will not generate a parse
#   error.
#
#   Note we do not use the `-t` option here (as we used to) because this
#   is not supported by MacOS zsh.
